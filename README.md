# SM Edge Gateway Connectors
The SM Edge Gateway is a small, on-prem component of the SM Platform that facilitates secure, high-speed ingress of data into the SM Platform.

The Gateway uses an extensible approach to protocol adaptation through the use of Connectors. Connectors can be used to adapt a variety of datasources to OPC UA for tranmission into the platform.

The Sample contained here illustrates how to build your own Connector, using the cross-platform .NET Core runtime and C#.
